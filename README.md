# Pitfall! Reinforcement Learning Agent

This project trains a Double DQN (Deep Q-Network) agent to play the classic Atari 2600 game Pitfall! using the Gymnasium
environment and PyTorch.
It includes environment preprocessing, experience replay, epsilon-greedy exploration, and periodic model checkpointing.

Training metrics (reward, loss, episode length) are logged automatically and can be visualized with a separate plotting script.
