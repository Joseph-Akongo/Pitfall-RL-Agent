1. Reward scaling / clipping

Classic DQN on Atari clips rewards to [-1, 1].

This keeps the network stable and prevents one huge reward from overwhelming training.

reward = np.sign(reward)   # -1, 0, or +1



2. Replay buffer & burn-in

Pitfall needs a huge replay buffer because of rare rewards.

You‚Äôre already at capacity=200_000. Consider 1 million if memory allows.

Burn-in (20,000) is okay. You could try 50,000 before starting learning so the buffer has more diversity.

3. Longer training

On Atari, DQN-style agents usually train for 50M steps or more.

Your current global_step_limit = 5_000_000 is good for debugging but too small for real progress.
üëâ For actual learning, crank it way up (10‚Äì50M).

4. Learning rate & batch size

lr=2.5e-4 and batch_size=32 are defaults from the Nature DQN paper.

Sometimes lowering LR (1e-4) helps stability.

Larger batch sizes (64 or 128) may help, but only if you have GPU memory.

5. Exploration schedule

You have epsilon decaying from 1.0 ‚Üí 0.1 over 1M steps.

For Pitfall, agents often keep higher exploration longer, since rewards are sparse.
üëâ Try decaying slower (e.g., 4M steps instead of 1M).

6. Target network sync

You‚Äôre syncing every 10,000 steps.
üëâ Try 30,000 or 50,000 to stabilize.

7. Environment modifications

Sticky actions (repeat last action with small probability) make learning harder but more realistic. You can ignore them for now.

Life loss termination: sometimes agents reset the episode when a life is lost, instead of waiting for game over. Pitfall doesn‚Äôt always benefit, but it‚Äôs worth testing.

8. Evaluation

Right now you only log metrics. Add an evaluation loop every N episodes:

def evaluate(agent, env, episodes=5):
    scores = []
    for _ in range(episodes):
        obs, _ = env.reset()
        state = obs_to_chw_tensor(obs)
        done = False
        total_r = 0
        while not done:
            action = agent.act(state)  # but with epsilon=0 for greedy
            obs, reward, term, trunc, _ = env.step(action)
            state = obs_to_chw_tensor(obs)
            done = term or trunc
            total_r += reward
        scores.append(total_r)
    return np.mean(scores)

How to actually learn

If your goal is to see progress quickly:

Don‚Äôt start with Pitfall. Try Breakout or Pong first ‚Äî they have dense rewards, and you‚Äôll see learning in minutes/hours.

Once your DQN works there, you‚Äôll know your pipeline is correct, and then you can scale up to Pitfall.

‚ÄúNumPy compatibility and observation shapes first, so the agent was actually seeing proper 4 stacked frames. Then we stopped double frame-skipping and added preprocessing so the data matched what DQN expects.
Now, to make the agent learn, we need to clip rewards, train for tens of millions of steps, and carefully tune exploration, buffer size, and learning rate. Pitfall is so sparse that the agent might need 50M+ steps to discover rewards, so testing first on easier Atari games like Pong or Breakout is the smarter way to validate our setup.‚Äù
